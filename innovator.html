                <h1>Meet Elizabeth Feinler</h1>
                <p>Elizabeth Feinler is a 93 year old woman born on March 2nd, 1931 in Wheeling, West Virginia, and she is still alive today. Elizabeth graduated from West Liberty University with a B.S. in chemistry, and from there she went to Purdue University for a Ph.D. in biochemistry (“Official Biography”). Before starting her thesis, she wanted to work and earn some money, so she joined Chemical Abstracts Service, where she served as assistant editor. After her work with the company, she became very interested in creating large data compilations. So she left biochemistry, and went to join Stanford Research Institute’s Information Research Division. Afterwards, she was picked up into the Augmentation Research Center, where she made a majority of her accomplishments. After retiring, she still assisted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California to help preserve the history of the Internet.</p>

                <h3>Contributions: </h3>
                <p>Elizabeth Feinler is among those scientists who have contributed to the development of the infrastructure of the Internet. She has especially contributed in the fields of Internet administration, directory services, and network protocol standardization during its earliest stages. She ran the ARPANET directory at SRI and led a group that developed the Domain Name System. It is a system applied to translate long numeric IP addresses to easy-to-remember domain names by users. She played an important role in the development of this system, and this action made the Internet more user-friendly and popular. From 1972 to 1989, she managed the NIC, which maintained early Internet "yellow pages" of resource availability and "white pages" of individual contacts. These are well known as the precursors of modern search engines and social networking sites. She also played an important role in standardizing and documenting the first Internet protocols that made communication between the networks possible.</p>

                <h3>Future Promise:</h3>
                <p>The technology that Elizabeth helped pioneer was the internet, which has a huge range of possible ways it could develop in the future. One way that we believe the internet could develop is becoming the new centralized banking system. With currencies such as Bitcoin already coming on to the scene and , although having some problems, showing that an online banking system can work, people may begin to refrain from trusting the government's economic ideas and focus on their own. Also, with AI becoming an ever growing presence in the world, the internet has and will continue to be influenced by it. While AI has many great advantages and properties, and further development of it will bring many new lanes of innovation, the problems with AI follow closely behind and we think the struggle between AI development and ethics will continue to be a fierce battle.</p>

                <h3>Underrepresentation:</h3>
                <p>Elizabeth Feinler's career in computer science and informatics is particularly remarkable because she worked in a field where women were severely underrepresented, especially during the early days of the technology industry. Throughout her career, Feinler had to navigate an environment largely dominated by men, where opportunities for women in leadership or technical roles were scarce.</p>
                
                <p>Information about direct challenges she faced as a woman in technology is limited, but it is known that, during her era, women were often overlooked for leadership roles and had to prove their capabilities repeatedly to gain recognition. Feinler’s perseverance and dedication were instrumental in overcoming these barriers, as evidenced by her leadership role in the development of early internet technologies, like the Domain Name System (DNS). Furthermore, she managed a team that was responsible for some of the most critical technical standards that underpin the modern internet, showcasing her ability to thrive in a demanding and competitive environment. While research into her specific struggles reveals limited documentation, this gap in the narrative itself highlights the historical trend of underreporting women's contributions to science and technology. Resources such as the Computer History Museum archives and personal interviews with Feinler provide insights into her career, though detailed accounts of gender-specific challenges are less prevalent. This absence reflects a broader systemic issue in how women's achievements were recorded and remembered, often overshadowed by the contributions of their male counterparts.</p>

                <p>Despite these hurdles, Feinler's impact remains a testament to her resilience and technical expertise. She not only contributed to the foundation of modern internet technologies but also became a role model for women in STEM, proving that underrepresented voices can lead transformative innovations.</p>

            <h3>Selection:</h3>
            <p>The reason why we decided on Elizabeth Feiler is because we wanted to do someone who had notoriety but also was not someone the professors would immediately know about. Some of our other options included Jennifer Widom, one of the first to create massive online courses open to all, as well as Hedy Lamar, the co-inventor of the radio guidance system, and Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming. The reason why this innovator rose above the rest of these amazing women is again, we did not want someone who was immediately recognizable by the professors. We wanted to highlight someone who made an impact in their own right, but they might not have stood out when compared to the greatest. That way we could truly bring up the underrepresented and give them a podium to stand upon.</p>
